Professional Portfolio

URL : 

I made a SINGLE page website. It has multiple tabs
linked together under a single navigation bar. (Home, About, Education,
Contact etc.)

Using javascript,CSS I've managed to make a typewriter which reads out hello world in the title.

Using CSS+JavaScript â€“ Toggle content was achieved on the menu item in a single page I.e.,
when clicked on Home tab, the content related to Home loads under the content
pane, when clicked on Education, the content related to education should load under the
same content pane without refreshing the page i.e using hide/show property of division.

Included my profile image and at least 2 more images (My Btech and Mtech college) through an external link. Images do have alt text in case they don't load.

Linked 2 external websites as hyperlink in the content-Education.

Included a table which makes use of merged table cells (rowspan and colspan). This was added in education section.

Website was made friendly using media query by changing the alignment of nav bar and font size respectively.

Link to my CV as PDF added through an external link.

Linked my professional Github and Linkedin profile.
